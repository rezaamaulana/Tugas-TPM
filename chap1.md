# **Introduction 1**

_It was a dark and stormy night._

<div style="text-align: justify">A storyteller might use these portentous words to capture your attention and draw you into a tale. A novelist might use the same words to begin the first page of a book. A radio play based on the same story could open with a crash of thunder and the howling of the wind. A film of the book could open on a scene of darkness, suddenly illuminated by a flash of lightning that reveals trees bent over in the gale.

>_Seorang pendongeng mungkin menggunakan kata-kata indah ini untuk menarik perhatian Anda dan menarik Anda ke dalam sebuah kisah. Seorang novelis mungkin menggunakan kata-kata yang sama untuk memulai halaman pertama sebuah buku. Drama radio berdasarkan cerita yang sama bisa dibuka dengan gemuruh guntur dan deru angin. Sebuah film dari buku itu bisa terbuka di adegan kegelapan, tiba-tiba diterangi oleh kilatan petir yang mengungkapkan pohon-pohon membungkuk di tengah badai._

<br>
The dark and stormy night can be represented in different media, each of which tells the story through different means, appealing to different senses. One of the key insights in computing is that all these media can be represented digitally, as a structured collection of bits, and can then be manipulated by programs on a computer, stored on disks and other storage devices, and transmitted over networks. Their shared digital representation means that different media can be combined into what is loosely called multimedia.

>_Malam yang gelap dan penuh badai dapat direpresentasikan dalam media yang berbeda, yang masing-masing menceritakan kisah melalui cara yang berbeda, menarik indra yang berbeda. Salah satu wawasan kunci dalam komputasi adalah bahwa semua media ini dapat direpresentasikan secara digital, sebagai kumpulan bit terstruktur, dan kemudian dapat dimanipulasi oleh program di komputer, disimpan di disk dan perangkat penyimpanan lainnya, dan ditransmisikan melalui jaringan. Representasi digital bersama mereka berarti bahwa media yang berbeda dapat digabungkan menjadi apa yang secara longgar disebut multimedia._

<br>
The combination of different media is not something new. On the contrary, established forms mix media routinely. A TV news bulletin, for example, might include sound and moving pictures — both live and recorded — still images, such as photographs of politicians, graphic illustrations, such as a histogram showing the trend in unemployment, and text, in the form of subtitles, captions, quotations, and credits, which will usually be accompanied by suitable annunciatory music. A contemporary live theatrical performance may incorporate two- or three-dimensional artwork and design (sets, backdrops, costumes), sound, which may be a mixture of speech and live music, perhaps with tape recordings and synthesized sounds, projected still and moving images, and sometimes text in the form of surtitles (written text displayed above the stage, which are often used for translation,especially in opera). The integration of media is natural  we perceive the world through all the senses we have at once; the separation of media is artificial, and may often seem unsatisfactory.

>_Kombinasi media yang berbeda bukanlah sesuatu yang baru. Sebaliknya, bentuk-bentuk mapan mencampur media secara rutin. Buletin berita TV, misalnya, mungkin menyertakan suara dan gambar bergerak — baik langsung maupun rekaman — gambar diam, seperti foto politisi, ilustrasi grafis, seperti histogram yang menunjukkan tren pengangguran, dan teks, dalam bentuk subtitle , keterangan, kutipan, dan kredit, yang biasanya akan disertai dengan musik peringatan yang sesuai. Pertunjukan teater langsung kontemporer dapat menggabungkan karya seni dan desain dua atau tiga dimensi (set, latar belakang, kostum), suara, yang mungkin merupakan campuran pidato dan musik langsung, mungkin dengan rekaman kaset dan suara yang disintesis, gambar diam dan gambar bergerak yang diproyeksikan. , dan terkadang teks dalam bentuk surtitle (teks tertulis yang ditampilkan di atas panggung, yang sering digunakan untuk terjemahan, terutama dalam opera). Integrasi media adalah wajar kita melihat dunia melalui semua indera yang kita miliki sekaligus; pemisahan media adalah buatan, dan mungkin sering tampak tidak memuaskan._

<br>
Consider film, for example. From the earliest days of cinema, in the absence of any method of recording and playing sound in synchronization with picture, separate live sounds were produced at the same time as the film was shown: not just the live piano accompaniment that you may find in contemporary art-house cinema showings of silent classics, but dialogue, singing, and sound effects, produced by actors, singers, and noisemakers in the theatre, often hidden behind the screen. So great was the film-going public's desire to hear sound naturally integrated with moving pictures that in 1927 when Al Jolson spoke his phrase, 'Wait a minute, wait a minute. You ain't heard nothing yet,' in The Jazz Singer, audiences stood up and cheered. It is hardly surprising, then, that once the technical obstacles to representing media digitally (which we will consider in Chapter 2) were overcome, the next step should be to combine separate media. In fact, the separation of digital media into distinct data types — different 'sorts of things' to which different operations can be applied — can be seen as a temporary exigency demanded by an immature technology.

>_Pertimbangkan film, misalnya. Sejak hari-hari awal perfilman, dengan tidak adanya metode perekaman dan pemutaran suara yang selaras dengan gambar, suara langsung yang terpisah diproduksi pada saat yang sama dengan pemutaran film: bukan hanya iringan piano langsung yang mungkin Anda temukan di zaman modern. sinema rumah seni pertunjukan klasik bisu, tetapi dialog, nyanyian, dan efek suara, yang diproduksi oleh aktor, penyanyi, dan pembuat kebisingan di teater, sering kali tersembunyi di balik layar. Begitu besar keinginan masyarakat penikmat film untuk mendengar suara yang terintegrasi secara alami dengan gambar bergerak sehingga pada tahun 1927 ketika Al Jolson mengucapkan kalimatnya, 'Tunggu sebentar, tunggu sebentar. Anda belum mendengar apa-apa,' di The Jazz Singer, penonton berdiri dan bersorak. Maka, tidak mengherankan jika hambatan teknis untuk merepresentasikan media secara digital (yang akan kita bahas di Bab 2) diatasi, langkah selanjutnya adalah menggabungkan media yang terpisah. Faktanya, pemisahan media digital ke dalam tipe data yang berbeda — 'jenis hal' yang berbeda yang dapat diterapkan operasi yang berbeda - dapat dilihat sebagai urgensi sementara yang diminta oleh teknologi yang belum matang._

## **Application of Multimedia**

What is it, then, if not the combination of media, that distinguishes digital multimedia from previous forms of combined media? It is the fact that the bits that represent text, sound, pictures, and so on can be treated as data by computer programs. The full potential of this fact has not yet been fully explored, but one facet of it immediately distinguishes digital multimedia from its predecessors. A program can control the order in which various components are presented and combined, and can do so in response to input from a computer user. In other words, digital multimedia can be interactive, in a way that, for example, a TV news bulletin is not, and that goes far beyond the simple control afforded by a VCR.

>_Lalu, jika bukan kombinasi media, apa yang membedakan multimedia digital dari bentuk-bentuk media gabungan sebelumnya? Fakta bahwa bit yang mewakili teks, suara, gambar, dan sebagainya dapat diperlakukan sebagai data oleh program komputer. Potensi penuh dari fakta ini belum sepenuhnya dieksplorasi, tetapi satu sisi langsung membedakan multimedia digital dari pendahulunya. Sebuah program dapat mengontrol urutan di mana berbagai komponen disajikan dan digabungkan, dan dapat melakukannya sebagai respons terhadap input dari pengguna komputer. Dengan kata lain, multimedia digital dapat menjadi interaktif, dengan cara yang, misalnya, buletin berita TV tidak, dan itu jauh melampaui kontrol sederhana yang diberikan oleh VCR._

The digital multimedia version of the story we began this book with could open with a picture depicting a dark and stormy night. By clicking on an icon on the screen, the user could cause the scene to play as a video clip, or add sound effects, according to their choice. Perhaps by clicking on different areas of the scene, details could be revealed, or a new scene could be introduced — a different one for each part of the first scene, allowing the tangled tale of betrayal and redemption that began on that dark stormy night to unfold in more than one way, told through the eyes of different characters. Users whose hearing was poor could choose to have a transcription of any dialogue displayed for them, while users with impaired vision could have a description of what was happening 'read' to them by their computer. Different interface options might be offered for users with different tastes and needs. If the story had attracted critical attention, it might be possible to bring up learned commentarieson particular aspects, or a  history of its telling in different media. There might be an opportunity for the user to take an active role, change the story, add new elements or recombine the existing ones.

Suppose, though, that this is not just a story — that some crime was committed on a real dark and stormy night, and that somebodyhad subsequently been arrested and charged with an offence. By collating evidence from witnesses, and facts about the location, the events of the night could be reconstructed and presented, like our story, as a mixture of animation, graphics, sound and video, with textual annotations. Members of the jury could then examine the event from different angles, verify that it was possible to see something at a certain distance, perhaps factor out the parts of the reconstruction based on a certain witness's evidence, or try out various hypotheses suggested by the lawyers in the case. Forensic multimedia of this sort is already being used in courts in the United States.

Digital multimedia may be used for many things besides stories and forensic reconstructions. The most prominent and economically significant uses of multimedia at present are in the fields of entertainment and education. At one extreme, the combination of sound, animation, video and text with interactivity is commonly found both in adventure games, such as Starship Titanic and action games, such as Doom and its bloody offspring. At the opposite extreme are the multimedia reference works, such as the Cinemania cinema encyclopedia, or the digital versions of the Encyclopedia Britannica.

Multimedia is also being used educationally in schools, and for extra-curricular and pre-school learning, where multimedia teaching materials can be used to present information in more direct ways than traditional books and lessons. For example, film clips and original recordings of radio broadcasts can be integrated with a textual account of events leading up to the Second World War in a modern history lesson. Virtual science experiments can be constructed using multimedia techniques, to allow pupils to work with simulations of equipment that is not available to them. In both these cases, interactive features allow pupils to work at their own pace, or to pursue specialized aspects of a project according to their particular interests. Multimedia teaching materials can be bought in as complete CD-ROM titles, or they can be made by teachers in their own schools. Children themselves can also make multimedia, in the form of project reports, or as an end in itself, as an electronic class book or newsletter.

The distinction between education and entertainment is not a clear one; several succesful multimedia CD-ROMs use elements of games for an educational purpose. For example, The Logical Journey of the Zoombinis develops children's problem-solving skills through a series of puzzles, organized in the form of a game. This approach to learning seems to be popular for very young children, with a range of titles available for teaching literacy and basic mathematics. These are aimed both at schools and at parents, for use in the home. (As a side-effect, the use of such materials also teaches computer skills from an early age.)

In contrast to the entertainment and education sectors, where most multimedia is professionally produced and marketed, much of the material used in business is produced for a specific company, often in-house. In a continuation of the use of multimedia in formal education, multimedia materials are used for training. As with the virtual science experiments in schools, multimedia can be used to produce interactive simulations of equipment and procedures, in cases where it would be expensive or hazardous to use the real thing for training. Multimedia is also used in sales presentations and promotions — for example, computers on sale in showrooms often run multimedia presentations describing their capabilities, and Web pages often function as sales brochures.

Some professions and business areas lend themselves especially well to multimedia. Graphic designers produce interactive presentations of their work as a supplement to, or even as a substitute for, a conventional portfolio. The electronic portfolio can be inexpensively duplicated on CD-ROM and sent to potential clients, or posted on a Web site as a virtual exhibition. In the shrinkwrapped software business, paper manuals have been gradually giving way to electronic documentation for some years. The move from hard copy to digital formats has provided an opportunity to augment the text and diagrams of conventional manuals with animations, video clips, and sound. Many programs now come with a multimedia product tour, demonstrating their best features, and interactive tutorials, which guide novice users through simple tasks.

One area in which computation plays a more active part is visualization, in which graphics and animation are used as a means of presenting complex data. Banal examples of visualizations include pie-charts and bar-charts being generated from spreadsheet data: their graphical form summarizes the data in a way that makes recognition of trends and comparisons between magnitudes possible at a glance. More complex data than the sort normally kept in spreadsheets demands more complex visualizations to provide the same degree of comprehensibility. Three-dimensional and timevarying presentations, making use of false colour to carry extra information, are often favoured. Such elaborate visualizations are frequently generated from simulations of complex dynamic systems: for example, a program that simulates atmospheric dynamics may generate a time-lapse movie of the gestation of a tropical storm; a program simulating an organic chemical reaction may generate a three-dimensional model of the structure of the molecules involved, showing the changes they undergo. As these examples show, visualization is widely used by scientists; it is also used in business, where the systems being tracked or simulated are financial, and the output is correspondingly more abstract.

The established entertainment industry, while still delivering an essentially linear and non-interactive product, now makes extensive use of digital multimedia technology in the production of everything from blockbuster movies to gardening programmes on TV. The use of connections with digitally delivered material, such as links between programming and supporting Web sites, or accompanying CD-ROMs for mainstream movies, is rapidly expanding. At the same time, a rapidly increasing number of festivals, conferences and other international events are providing showcases for "new media" at all levels from the artistic avant garde to the purely commercial.

## **Delivery of Multimedia**

The applications we have mentioned so far are all basically concerned with presenting material, using a combination of media, in an interactive way. Some means of delivery is required, to get this material from its producer to its consumers. It is useful to distinguish between online and offline delivery.

Online delivery uses a network to send information from one computer, often a server machine providing centralized storage of bulky data, to another, usually a personal computer on somebody's desk. The network in question may be a local area network serving a single organization, but more often it will be the Internet. In particular, the World Wide Web has established itself as a popular means of delivering multimedia online.

> The World Wide Web has achieved such supremacy as a means of accessing data over the Internet that in popular perception the Web and the net are sometimes seen as synonymous. This is not the case, as we will explain in Chapter 2, and in more detail in Chapter 15.

Where multimedia is delivered offline, some removable storage medium must be used. The widespread deployment of CD-ROM drives in personal computers in the mid-1990s was, to some extent, responsible for the surge in interest in multimedia at that time. This is because, for the first time, it made available a form of storage with adequate capacity (around 650 Mbytes, compared to the 1.44 Mbytes of floppy disks) to accommodate the large files characteristic of multimedia data, while still being relatively inexpensive to duplicate. The data transfer rate of early CD-ROM drives was too slow to support playback of video and sound, but more recent models have increased the speed, to the point where multimedia can be played directly from a CD-ROM, although smooth playback of full-screen video from CD-ROM is still impossible without additional hardware support.

While online delivery is widely seen as the future for multimedia, the low bandwidth available for most domestic connections to the Internet means that, especially for large and elaborate work, offline delivery on CD-ROM remains popular. There is an increasing trend towards a combination of offline and online delivery, with CDROMs being used to hold a fixed collection of data, augmented with links to Web sites, where updates and supporting information are available (sometimes for a supplementary fee).

In 1995, an industry consortium announced the specification for a successor to CD-ROM, using the same size and shape platters, called DVD. Originally, this stood for Digital Video Disk, since the format was intended as a replacement for VHS cassettes as a distribution medium for video, as analogue methods of storing video began to be replaced by digital methods. It was immediately understood that DVD could be used equally well for any digital data, just as the audio Compact Disc had been adapted as the CD-ROM. Accordingly, the name was changed, somewhat desperately, to Digital Versatile Disk, thus keeping the abbreviation DVD. DVD offers a much higher storage capacity (up to 17 Gbytes on a double-sided disk), with similar transfer rates to modern (12x and higher) CD-ROM drives. Despite considerable media enthusiasm for DVD, it has not been taken up as rapidly as originally predicted, but during 1999, an increasing number of personal computers were being shipped with DVD drives fitted. Since these drives can also read CD-ROMs, it seems likely that they will become standard peripherals, and that DVD will be used to deliver multimedia, especially high quality video.

Online delivery, however, offers possibilities which are not available offline. In particular, it enables the delivery of (almost) live multimedia content, which in turn makes possible novel applications such as video conferencing and broadcast multimedia. Generally, when multimedia is delivered online, the delivery need not be passive, in the way that it is from CD-ROM: things can happen at the delivering end; for example, a database query can be executed.

## **Historical Context**

Compared with established forms such as film or the novel, multimedia is still in its earliest days. The CD-ROM specification was published in 1985, with drives appearing on desktop machines from about 1989; the World Wide Web became publicly available outside CERN at the start of 1992, in the form of a line-based browser giving access to a handful of servers; by January 1997, when the HTML 3.2 specification was adopted as a World Wide Web Consortium Recommendation, audio and video were only supported in Web pages through the use of proprietary extensions. We have become so accustomed to the high speed of technological change in computing that multimedia is already seen as an established feature of the computing landscape. But, on the time-scale of cultural change, it has barely arrived.

The history of film and animation, for example, demonstrates that it takes time — much longer than digital multimedia has existed — for conventions about content and consumption to become established. The very first films exhibited to the public, by the Lumiere brothers at the Grand Cafe on the Boulevard des Capucines, in Paris in 1895, showed such subjects as workers going home from a factory, and a train arriving at a station. To be able to reproduce movement was enough, without the farrago of plot, character, or message we normally associate with films. The early trick films of Georges Melies were shown as part of his magic show, in the same way as the magic lantern projections he used to create illusions. In a similar vein, Winsor McCay's Gertie the Dinosaur, one of the first short animations made in America (in 1909), was used as an integral part of his vaudeville act. While Gertie did tricks, McCay stood in front of the screen on stage and talked to her, telling her what to do, and scolding her when she got it wrong1 , in response to which Gertie started to cry; finally McCay appeared to walk into the frame and ride off on the dinosaur's back.

At the same time, films, including narrative and animation, were already being shown, particularly in Europe, as entertainments in their own right, purely to be watched on a screen. The diversity of early ways of using film shows that there was originally no consensus about a 'right' way to present a film. Later on, anything other than a cinema screening would be seen as eccentric. Even films that attempted to use the medium in original ways would mainly do so within the cinema context, and a film shown in other ways, for example projected onto the floor of a gallery, would be re-defined — for example, as an 'installation'.

Another notable feature of early cinema is the way in which established forms were translated into the new medium. In particular, the newsreels shown around the time of the First World War were based on the same principles as a newspaper, even to the extent of including an animated cartoon corresponding to a comic strip. Characters were transported from the comic strips to film, and the animators who brought them to life were often (but not always) the artists who had drawn the strips. Perhaps more to the point, one of the most succesful studios producing newsreels and animations was the International Film Service, owned by the newspaper proprietor William Randolph Hearst — who also owned the syndication rights to many popular comic strips of the period.

Remember that the time we are now describing was twenty years after the invention of cinema, yet we still find film looking to earlier media for its forms and content. In a similar way, multimedia still adopts the format of earlier media; the most obvious example is the multimedia encyclopedia, which has the same form — a series of short articles, accessible through one or more indexes — as its paper equivalent, and is often published by the same organization. Other reference works also follow the form of reference books, sometimes, as in the case of some of Dorling-Kindersley's CD-ROMs, following the distinctive house style of their originals. Electronic software manuals rarely depart far from the organization of hard-copy manuals, merely adding better searching facilities and sometimes some animation.

One of the things that was needed before film could acquire its distinct character as a medium was an appreciation of the way the movie camera and film could be used to create new sorts of images, by framing, movement, editing and special effects. In multimedia, part of what is presently missing is a real understanding of how we can take advantage of the fact that digital multimedia is data, to integrate the presentation of multimedia with computation. For the moment, we are largely confined to controlling the presentation interactively, and to moving the data across networks.

## **Multimedia Production**

The making of multimedia requires software not only for the preparation of individual media elements, but for their integration into a finished production. Programs that allow a designer to assemble different media elements in space and time, and add interactive behaviour to them, are usually called authoring systems. These must interpret user actions and commands in non-trivial ways in order to translate the mode of working that is natural to a designer, who will usually feel most comfortable with direct manipulation of the elements on a virtual pasteboard or its equivalent, into the data and control structures of the finished piece of work.

Multimedia authoring systems take many forms, though: if we are currently unsure about the form of multimedia, we are equally uncertain about the best means of producing it. Again taking film for comparison, we find a well-defined set of jobs, from director to clapper operator, and established procedures for coordinating the stages of production that are involved in the making of a finished film. No equivalent division of labour or procedures have yet been established for multimedia. Some authoring systems, such as Director, attempt to provide tools for the production of all types of media element as well as for their integration, almost as if a single person could do the whole job, working on different parts at the same time. Other tools, such as Photoshop, only work with one type, suggesting a division of labour along the lines of the different media, but requiring separate mechanisms and a separate production stage for integration.

Just as the forms of multimedia are largely derived from the forms of other media, so attempts to impose order on the process of making multimedia are largely based on procedures from other media. Storyboards, for example, are sometimes advocated as a means of making and communicating multimedia designs. Storyboards are used in large animation studios, and by music video and advertisement producers, to plan the construction of a piece of work, and to communicate its structure among the team producing it. (In the industries where Storyboards are widely used, they are also a means of selling ideas to financial backers.) A storyboard is simply a sequence of still pictures, showing the composition of shots at key points in the production. Rather like a blueprint, it records a plan of the work, which can be used to organize its subsequent development. One of the things that makes Storyboards effective is the way they can be read linearly like a comic strip. As we will see in later chapters, and as you probably know from your own experience of Web pages and CD-ROMs, multimedia is often arranged non-linearly, with the possibility of taking branches, so that the elements may be displayed in different orders. When nonlinearity is added to a storyboard, by annotating it with arrows, for example, the clarity with which it communicates structure, and thus its raison d'etre, is lost. Conversely, starting out with the fundamentally linear format of a storyboard when planning multimedia will inevitably prejudice the designer in favour of linear structures.

> A parallel can be drawn with the use of flowcharts for program design. The conventions of 'classical' flowcharts can only represent conditional and unconditional branches. A flowchart design therefore suggests an implementation in terms of jumps, not in terms of the higher level control structures supported by modern programming languages. The 'structured programming' movement of the 1970s discarded flowcharts, in favour of working directly with programming language constructs that express control abstractions. It might be hoped that multimedia authoring tools might themselves take on a design role, in a similar fashion.

<br>

---
## **Terminology**

A telling symptom of the immaturity of digital multimedia is the absence of satisfactory terminology. What do you call a mixture of media under software control? Where the display and presentation of the media elements is the sole purpose, as in a Web page or an encyclopedia on CD-ROM, we will usually refer to a multimedia production. Where the display of the multimedia is more intimately bound up with computation, we will refer to a multimedia application. A simple example of a multimedia production might be a Web page containing a chronological listing of forthcoming film festivals, with some attached images and video clips. A multimedia application using the same data could provide an interface (which might still be a Web page) to a database containing the festivals' details and related material, so that a user could search for festivals in a particular geographical area, or those that accepted material on video tape, and so on. The distinction between the two is not a sharp one. A certain amount of computation might be done to control the presentation of a multimedia production, so there is a continuum from productions that simply present material in a fixed way, through increasingly complex interactivity, to applications that generate multimedia dynamically.

There remains another question. We know that we read text, look at images, watch video and listen to sound, but what do we do to a multimedia production? All of these, perhaps, as well as interacting with it. There is no satisfactory term either for the act or for the person who performs it. For the latter, we reluctantly fall back on the over-worked and vague term user. The usage at least has the virtue that it draws attention to the active role that, potentially anyway, a user adopts with relation to most multimedia productions. Although much influential critical work has focused on the active role of the reader in creating readings of texts, this activity is of a cerebral and largely unconscious type. In contrast, the user of multimedia is active in a literal sense, using input devices such as the mouse and keyboard to control what goes on — within the limits allowed by the multimedia producer.

It can be useful to distinguish between multimedia and multiple media. The distinction is best understood from the point of view of the user. It is commonplace that we perceive different media in different ways: we just referred to reading text, looking at pictures, listening to sound, and so on. Cognitive scientists call these different sorts of perception modalities. A multiple media production requires us to switch between modalities, for example, by reading some text, then looking at a picture, and so on. Many early 'multimedia' CD-ROM presentations were like this. True multimedia requires us to combine modalities (as we do in real life think of the experience of walking through a shopping mall, for example), or even develop new ones, to cope with the combination of media. A familiar example is the pop video, where the music and moving images are (usually) presented as a composite — arguably often to the detriment of one or the other considered in isolation with, for example, visual action illustrating lyrics, and scenes being cut in time to the beat of the music.

While modalities provide a useful way of thinking about multimedia from a cognitive point of view, we prefer to adopt a definition more in keeping with the technical emphasis of this book, and consider digital multimedia to be any combination of two or more media represented in a digital form, sufficiently well integrated to be presented via a single interface, or manipulated by a single computer program.

This definition is broader than some that have been proposed. It is quite common to require at least one of the media to be a timebased one, such as sound or video. It is certainly true that, at present, the addition of time introduces significant new technical difficulties, which may be considered sufficiently challenging to make a qualitative difference between such dynamic multimedia and purely static multimedia, involving only text and images. However, we consider these difficulties to be transient effects of the current state of the underlying digital technologies, and prefer to use the more general definition just given.

## **Interactivity**

> "You can mistake endless choice for freedom"
Bruce Springsteen, speaking on BBC2, December 1998.

He was talking about something more momentous than multimedia productions, of course, but his words are curiously appropriate to the way in which interactivity has been applied to multimedia.

Interactivity is frequently portrayed as the feature that distinguishes digital multimedia from other forms of combined media, such as television. It is often claimed that it puts the user in control — by implication, in a way that has not previously been possible: "Interactivity empowers the end users of your project by letting them control the content and flow of information."2  While there  is some truth in this, it should be recognized that the amount of control offered is strictly limited within parameters established by the multimedia producer. This must be the case in any situation where interaction takes place with a finite system responding according to a program. Only choices that are coded into the program are allowed. However, providing choices in a computer program is much easier than providing choices via a hardware device such as through the controls of a VCR so it is possible in a multimedia production to allow the user to control events at many points. Where a sequence of choices can be made in succession, the possibilities expand combinatorially: if, for example, there are four choices at each of five stages of a production, although only twenty branches must be programmed, there is a total of 4^5  = 1024 possible sequences which can be followed; that is, 1024 possible ways of experiencing the production. Such a range of possible experience might well be mistaken for freedom, but ultimate control over "the content and flow of information" remains with the producer not the user, and even a significantly increased range of choices will not necessarily enhance a production. In certain cases  e.g. the provision of access to information in facilities such as Web site railway timetables a single, fast, optimized route to the required information is all that is needed. And no amount of interactivity can compensate for poor or dull content, or bad organization of the work — one of the worst cases of this is when, through a series of selections on buttons, etc., one navigates through a site to find that the desired page is an empty space labelled "under construction".

The character of interaction can be appreciated by considering how it operates in the popular game Myst. The player is presented with a series of images, depicting scenes in an imaginary world. Sometimes, if you click on an object, something happens — doors open, machines operate, and so on. When the cursor is placed near the edge of the screen, it changes shape and a mouse click causes the scene to change, as if you had walked out of the frame into the adjoining space; in this way you can, for example, walk round a building. Apart from that, there are no controls, such as buttons, so the game demands a process of exploration before you can find out how to make anything happen. Advertising copy and reviews of the game placed great emphasis on the idea that you have to explore a fantastic world. In fact, though, all that your choices and explorations enable you to do is to complete a few little puzzles, obtaining fragments of a story along the way, until you reach the end. You don't have any choice over this — if you can't work out the combination to open a door, you can't attack it with a crowbar instead, for example. All you can do is go off and try a different puzzle, or give up. However, the extraordinary popularity of Myst demonstrates how interactivity, when embedded in a rich environment with high-quality graphics and evocative sound, can dramatically increase the attractiveness of a production. It is hard to believe that the puzzles presented on their own, or the flimsy piece of fantasy fiction upon which the game is built, would draw the same audience.

>   'Interactivity' is really a misnomer — although we will continue to use the term in deference to its wide currency. When the computer's role is to present choices and respond to them, it cannot be said to be keeping up its end of an interaction, while at the same time it reduces the user's options for contributing to the intercourse to a few mouse gestures. The application of artificial intelligence can improve the level of discourse, but (with all due respect to Alan Turing) true interaction is only possible where another person is involved. Even then, if the interaction is mediated by a program, the form it can take may be severely limited. In many contemporary
